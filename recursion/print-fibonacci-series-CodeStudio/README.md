# Print Fibonacci Series

## Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using a generator function.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
n = 5
```
**Output:**
```
0 1 1 2 3
```
**Explanation:**
The first 5 Fibonacci numbers are: `0, 1, 1, 2, and 3`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
n = 3
```
**Output:**
```
0 1 1
```
**Explanation:**
The first 3 Fibonacci numbers are `0, 1, and 1`.

## Notes
- You don't need to print anything. Just implement the given function.

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 45`

## Expected Time Complexity
The expected time complexity is `O(n)`.

## Approach
Solve the problem using recursion to generate the Fibonacci series.
