# **Bubble Sort Using Recursion in C++**  

## **Description**  
This program sorts an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm implemented with recursion. Instead of using nested loops, it recursively swaps adjacent elements and reduces the problem size in each step.  

## **Algorithm**  
1. **Base Case**: If the array has only one element, return.  
2. **Recursive Step**:  
   - Perform one full pass of swapping adjacent elements.  
   - Recursively call the function on the reduced array.  

## **Time Complexity**  
- **Worst & Average Case**: O(n²)  
- **Best Case (Already Sorted Array)**: O(n²)  

## **Usage**  
- Compile and run the program in a C++ environment.  
- Modify the `arr` variable to test with different inputs.
